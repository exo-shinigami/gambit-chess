# Gambit Chess - New Features Quick Guide

## 🎮 How to Use the New Features

### 1. Move Highlighting (Green Highlights)

**What it does:** Shows all legal moves for a selected piece

**How to use:**
1. Click on any piece (it must be your turn and your color)
2. The selected square will turn **YELLOW**
3. All possible destination squares will be highlighted in **GREEN**
4. Click on any green square to move there
5. Click the piece again to deselect

**Example:**
```
Click on a knight → See all 8 possible L-shaped moves highlighted in green
Click on a rook   → See all horizontal and vertical moves highlighted
Click on a pawn   → See forward moves and diagonal captures
```

### 2. King in Check (Red Highlight)

**What it does:** Automatically highlights your king when in danger

**How it works:**
- If your king is in check, the king's square turns **BRIGHT RED**
- This happens automatically - no action needed
- The red highlight disappears once you move out of check
- Works for both White and Black

**Visual Indicator:**
```
Normal King Square: Regular board color
King in Check:      🔴 Bright Red Background
```

### 3. Pawn Promotion (Choose Your Piece!)

**What it does:** Lets you choose which piece to promote your pawn to

**How to use:**
1. Move a pawn to the opposite end of the board (8th rank for White, 1st rank for Black)
2. A **promotion dialog** will appear showing 4 choices:
   - ♕/♛ **Queen** (most powerful)
   - ♖/♜ **Rook** (strong for endgame)
   - ♗/♝ **Bishop** (useful for diagonal control)
   - ♘/♞ **Knight** (great for tactics)
3. Click on the piece you want OR press the keyboard shortcut:
   - **Q** = Queen
   - **R** = Rook
   - **B** = Bishop
   - **N** = Knight
4. Your pawn transforms into the chosen piece

**Pro Tip:** Queen is the strongest choice in most situations, but sometimes a knight is better to avoid stalemate or deliver checkmate!

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

   - Use the green highlights to plan multi-move strategies

2. **Avoiding Blunders:**
   - The red king highlight warns you of danger
   - Make sure to resolve check immediately

3. **Pawn Promotion Strategy:**
   - Usually promote to Queen (most powerful)
   - Promote to Knight if it gives immediate checkmate
   - Promote to Rook/Bishop in special endgame situations
   - Under-promotion can prevent stalemate

4. **Captured Pieces:**
   - Track material advantage by comparing the columns
